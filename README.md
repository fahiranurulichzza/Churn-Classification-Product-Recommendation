2. Research by Tianpei Xu et al. emphasizes the cost-effectiveness of retaining existing customers (5-10 times more) compared to acquiring new ones, highlighting the financial impact of high churn rates on revenue.
3. The company lacks a clear internal customer segmentation strategy, making it challenging to tailor approaches to meet diverse customer needs.
4. Ineffective treatment strategies, stemming from a lack of customer needs understanding, adversely impact overall customer satisfaction.
